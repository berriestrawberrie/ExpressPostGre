# 🎮 Express PostGre Practice

## 📘 Description
In this assignment, you’ll build on your PostgreSQL skills by integrating it with Node.js and Express. You’ll create an API that performs advanced database queries similar to those you practiced last week.

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berriestrawberrie/ExpressPostGre

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start Docker  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Run the server

## 🚀 Using the API

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Endpoint: `GET /top-players`
Returns the top 3 players with the highest total scores across all games, sorted in descending order.

```

Let me know if you want badges, environment setup notes, or a sample response from the API!
